# Brain Tumor Detection Streamlit App

## Description
This Streamlit app allows you to upload an MRI image and predict if there's a brain tumor or not. The app uses a trained Keras model to make the predictions.

## Deploy the Model From here
https://brain-tumor-detection.streamlit.app/

## Dataset for Training the Model
To train the model, we used the MRI brain tumor dataset. You can download the dataset containing Images from the following link:
